               framework based on Bogart, inspired by Sinatra, and written
               in C++.
 
This is a Sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html) inspired framework.

The work is bassed on the Bogart C framework.

The kernel works with the same main idea, but it is meant to be a
C++ simple to use and implent framework.

In the MainSample.cpp file you can find a quick sample of its functinality.

To complie simply use:

  make
  
To clean project:

  make clean

This project uses Libevent library for its core functinality. In my case
works perfectly fine with 2.0.5 version. It is needed to install it before
linking. In Debian based systems it will be made with:

  sudo aptitude install libevent-dev
